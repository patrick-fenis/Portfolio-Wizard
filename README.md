# Portfolio-Wizard
This is an app that allows you to track your current stock holdings. I utiliza mongodb Atlas to store stock holding information. The user 
is able to add to their portfolio as well as adjust their already submitted holdings. There is a more detailed view of each stock holding
that shows more information about the held equity. I've also connected a stock data API which allows the user to check on the current market
data for any of their stock holdings.
